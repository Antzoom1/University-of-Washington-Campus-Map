# Tests that a singular edge can be added to a graph.

# Create a graph
created graph threeNodesGraph

# Add three nodes
added node 1 to threeNodesGraph
added node 2 to threeNodesGraph
added node 3 to threeNodesGraph

# Add one edge
added edge e1 from 1 to 2 in threeNodesGraph

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from 1
threeNodesGraph contains: 1 2 3
the children of 1 in threeNodesGraph are: 2(e1)
