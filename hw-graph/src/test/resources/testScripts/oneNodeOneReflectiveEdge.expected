# Tests that a singular edge that points to and from one node.

# Create a graph
created graph oneNodeGraph

# Add one node
added node 1 to oneNodeGraph

# Add one edge
added edge e1 from 1 to 1 in oneNodeGraph

# Print the node in the graph and the outgoing edges from 1
oneNodeGraph contains: 1
the children of 1 in oneNodeGraph are: 1(e1)
