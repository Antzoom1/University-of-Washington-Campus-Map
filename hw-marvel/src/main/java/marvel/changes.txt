Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel, and why you made those changes.

I added a getEdges method because I realized I needed to obtain the edges
in order to build the graph and find paths. Other thanthat, I didn't change anything.

Resubmission: I finally got the program to run smoothly. However, the runtime took way too long. After attending
office hours, the ta there told me that I probably shouldn't be using 2d arrays to parse through all the code in marvel.
I instead used a Map to build and find my paths in MarvelPaths. I also added a edge class which was really convenient
since I was able to get the edges data a lot easier than previously with the 2d arrays. I fixed up some tests and made sure
to pass everything this time.
