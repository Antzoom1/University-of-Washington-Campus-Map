1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test because the code included zero in the condition. Since
0 is nonnegative, this means the statement wouldn't be correct. I changed the "<=" sign to < to exclude the zero.



2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because the condition in the else if statement would include n to have 3 possible
values (since the cat is 0, the possibilities were 0,1, and 2. This wouldn't be the case because the base case must be only
the previous 2 values. 3 values would not be necessary. I change the code to "n <= 1" ("n < 2" works too) so that the base
case would be correct.



3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.
The Fibonacci did not fail the testInductiveCase test. This is because the recursion follows the conept of Fibonacci correctly.
What the previous 2 terms of the value currently at n would be the sum of it. The previous 2 values are adding to each other to
produce the sum of the next value.
